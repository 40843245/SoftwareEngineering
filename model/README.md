# Preface
I will list some models that help one to plan to develope and test the software project.
# Type
## Waterfall model
### Main concept
1. Sequentially: Each process is planned strictly before developed the software project. And the next process will NOT be executed until the current process is done.

### Why name is it?
Each process is sequentially processed, at top to down, which looks like the water falls.
### Feature
1. Topdown : Process is processed at top to down.

## Incremental model
### Main concept
1. Incremental: It applies the waterfall model incrementally.

### Derivative
The main concept is derived from waterfall model.

## Iterative model
### Main concept
1. Iterative: One will repeat the process (iteratively) until the project finishes.

## Open-source Development
### Main concept
1. open sharing: Open source refers sharing. One can share it once one finish develops. 
2. third-party: Of course, one also can use other third-party module to develop.

Note that, NOT be confused with open source software development, even though they have similar concepts. There are slightly difference between their usage.

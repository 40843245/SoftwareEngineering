# Preface
I will list some models that help one to plan to develope and test the software project.
# Type
## Waterfall model
### Main concept
1. Sequentially: Each process is planned strictly before developed the software project. And the next process will NOT be executed until the current process is done.

### Why name is it?
Each process is sequentially processed, at top to down, which looks like the water falls.
### Feature
1. Topdown : Process is processed at top to down.

## Incremental model
### Main concept
1. Incremental: It applies the waterfall model incrementally.

### Derivative
The main concept is derived from waterfall model.

## Iterative model
### Main concept
1. Iterative: One will repeat the process (iteratively) until the project finishes.

## Open-source Development
### Main concept
1. open sharing: Open source refers sharing. One can share it once one finish develops. 
2. third-party: Of course, one also can use other third-party module to develop.

Note that, NOT be confused with open source software development, even though they have similar concepts. There are slightly difference between their usage.

## Agile model
### Main concept
1. Documentation continuously: Documentation is made throughout the life-cycle, in parallel to the creation of the rest of the solution.
2. Documentation late: Documentation is made as late as possible.
3. Executable specifications: Requirements are specified in the form of executable "customer tests", instead of non-executable "static" documentation.
4. Single source information: Infomation must be only available at one place, avoiding the confusion to user when using the module.

### Limitation
Although there are many advantages than the other software development, such as the above items in main concept section, 
it is very hard to apply it due to its limitations.

1. On large teams ( >= 30 people ).
2. Without adequate tooling support.
3. Members of teams can NOT share and collaborate on models. (To satisfy the 4th item in main concept section)
4. When modeling skilling are weak or even lacking.

# Term

#### Control coupling 
控制耦合

## Cohesion
### Intro
How closely something stick to each other.
### Type
#### Logical cohesion
#### Functional cohesion
1. well-defined: In functional cohesion, all parts contribute to a single module which single tasks is well-defined. Thus, all parts of modules are groups.
For example, see the example in following link.
#### Temporal cohesion
#### Procedural cohesion
#### Informational cohesion
#### Sequential cohesion
#### Perfect cohesion (atomic)
1. Atomic: It is atomic, it can NOT be splited into many parts so that there are NOT race condition.

# Preface
I will discuss the concept object-oriented programming.

## OOP
### Inheritance
Inheritance refers inherit from parent class so that one does NOT need to declared it again in the base class.

### Abstraction
### Encapsulation
Encapsulation encapuslate the member of class so that restrict the access of member. One famous term is related to encapsulation -- Protection level, which can be categorized into private, protected, public.

### Polymorphism
#### Overloading
Overloading refers declares many function or method etc with same identifier but either with different number of parameter or with different type of parameter (or both).

#### Overriding
Overriding refers redefines an existing method in a class with same identifier to its parent class.

#### Overloading v.s. Overriding
1. Overloading:

       different number of parameter or different type of parameter or both.

       NOT neccessary that base class has parent class and its parent class has the method.
   
3. Overriding:
  
       both same number of parameter and same type of parameter.

       Neccessary that base class has parent class and its parent class has the method.
